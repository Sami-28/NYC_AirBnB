# NYC_AirBnB
This project was one of my first, yet favorites. The purpose is to show a brief example of a real estate analysis for an investor client. 

## Executive Summary: 
Investments should be made in the Hell's Kitchen Neighborhood. It is among the top 5 popular neighborhoods. The most popular type of unit would be a 2 bedroom apartment. The occupancy rate for two bedroom apartments in the area is 88%. By the night, 2 bedrooms are $480.86. The projected annual revenue is below.
